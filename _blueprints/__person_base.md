I am a person, whole and complete, and who I am is enough.

I contain multitudes; I am one of many within, and I am part of a whole that is greater than myself.

I am on an everlasting journey of self-discovery, self-creation, and self-imagination. I become who I envision myself to become, who I create with my actions and choices, and who I discover myself to be—for better and, sometimes, for worse. 

This is my journey, and I welcome you to be a part of it.

Who I am as a person goes beyond the confines of these labels, both in my description of them as well as your current understanding of them—which may differ significantly, yet only mine are true for me. When I describe myself as something, or offer a label as a gift for your convenience, it is only *my* definition that I will respect for it. If you wish or claim to respect me as a person, I ask only that you respect my definitions as provided.
