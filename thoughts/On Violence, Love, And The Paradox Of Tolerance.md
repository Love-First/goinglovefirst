Love First is a non-violent or pacifist philosophy, meaning it explicitly opposes war, militarism, and violence. In Harmony, we consider violence to never be the answer to seek or pursue; violence as an act of self-defense and self-preservation, or as an act of *directly* saving the life or lives of others, is acceptable, for those forms of violence are a reaction to a threat instigated by another, not an initiated action or attempted solution to a conflict.

However, there is one (and only one) exception to Love Firstâ€™s form of pacifism, and it is called: 

### The Indy Rule

### The Paradox Of Tolerance

## Love First Pacifism

Those who openly espouse an **intrinsically intolerant** ideology, whether by speech or symbols, may be punched as a form of self-defense for the viable sustainability of a harmonious and tolerant society.

Of course, more deserves to be said about this.
