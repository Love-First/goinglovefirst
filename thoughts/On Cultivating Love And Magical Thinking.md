I know it sometimes may seem like I believe that love is all it takes to make a brighter future for everyone. That love, cultivated and applied wisely, can turn even the most hateful souls back into healing hearts. And to a degree, yes, I do believe it does—but I’m not seeing love through a lens of magical thinking. 

Love is not some cosmic force that can magically make the world a better place, just by people becoming better at it. The work still needs to be done, for us to bring about positive change at a societal level. Cultivating love is first and foremost about *how* we do that work, and how we experience that journey.

So why do I think cultivating love is, nonetheless, one of the most important things we must do today? Ask yourself this: can you imagine making the world a better place _without_ love? Personally, I don’t even want to; I did that once before, 21 years ago, and I depressingly predicted the future that is today’s painful present.

This time, I’d rather write us a better future; a world built on love.
