# Love Is…

```
Love is a feeling that transcends all power
	of words to describe it,
	of music to convey it,
	of pictures to portray it,
		and do it any justice.

Love is the joy of living life fully, 
	and the profoundest power 
	for healing life’s pains.

Love is an instrument waiting to be played, 
	a skill to be developed, 
	an abundant talent 
		in your inner being.

Love is a state of being in itself, 
	with the tranquility of peace
	and the flow of a river.

Love is peace in its desired motion.

Love is boundless and defies description, 
	an energy that attracts 
	and celebrates wavelengths—
		those that match it
		and those that need it.

Love is universal, a Force that’s all around us,
	inside us, 
	flowing through us,
	and giving us the strength
		to awaken within
			our brightest 
			most luminous
			and brilliant 
				true selves.

Love is truly beyond my comprehension
	and yet I’m starting 
	to understand it.
```
