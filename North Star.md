# Our North Star

The term “North Star” is part of [[The Language Of Love]], a common lexicon of phrases & references that create a shared vocabulary and fosters greater understanding.



## A World That Works With Love For All Of Us

And we’d absolutely love for you to join us!

We believe that [[Love Is]] a feeling so powerfully alive in the heart that no matter who you are, where you’re from, what you’ve done 

Your mission should you choose to accept it, is to practice developing a deeper understanding of the many more facets and elements of love. 

In order to align our every effort and action and thought and dream and creation in harmonious ways, we have a shared [[North Star]] and use the framework of [[Universal Love]].
