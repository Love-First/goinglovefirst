# I Am Going Love First

I want to live in a world where we love each other universally. Where we we accept others for who they are without desire to change them, instead supporting them to explore and develop their most authentic, unique, and best versions of themselves. Where our economic and political systems are transformed, reimagined with caring for both people and planet as their new foundations. A world where we heal ourselves and all around us through conscious collaboration, community, and stewardship.

A World That Works With Love For All

This world is made for You, dear reader. No matter who you are, where you’re from, or what you’ve done, you belong in this world. And it is within reach, believe it or not! The seeds of love have long been planted, growing tenderly with each nurturing act. Today they have become saplings and trees; tomorrow, a canopy of conviction.

Sure, there still is darkness in this world, it’s easy to see when you look for it. But I’ve learned to see what love looks like—*Universal* Love, that is—and now I can’t stop seeing it everywhere.

Universal Love is each moment of Truth, however uncomfortable it may be, and each moment of growth and of change. It is the connection we share through our stories, and the hope and belief that a better world is possible.

Universal Love is a calmness of the soul, a tranquility of the spirit; a peacefulness in the body, an endless warmth in the heart. It is an acceptance of all as it is, and the denouement to the grief process of existence. It heals what seemed previously beyond repair. 

My heart was broken, into billions of pieces.

The world was on fire, the skies bright orange. People were sick, and dying all over. Anguish was as breath itself, dangling and dancing between the ashes in the air. Polarized perspectives and political power play plunged our culture into pits of despair. Vitriol and catastrophe had become the new norm, the language and lens through which we learned about life.

And all through the days, and all through the nights, Love lay in waiting, yearning to be seen. Yearning to be heard and to be understood, for if only people remembered its tongue, if only people knew… Love is always there for them. Available, accessible, and at all times.

Love is the very First language we learn as we come into being in this ‘verse. The problem we face, From A Certain Point Of View, is that we are taught a different one from birth.

I’ve trained my brain in the pattern of Love, to recognize the fabric it weaves every turn. I’ve come to believe, based on all that I know, that Love is a language that we can now learn.

Love First is a mission to build this new world: 
A World That Works With Love For All

To develop its vocabulary, The Building Blocks Of Love, and put what we learn into practice each day.

I am Going Love First, and this is my story.
