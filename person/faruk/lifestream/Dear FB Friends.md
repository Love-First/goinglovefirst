This is what i'm doing:

%% 		Only Look At 'What You Want' And 
			Don't Resent What Made You Want What You Want
%%
- I am at a starting point
	- there is always more, and so I am always at a starting point
- I got •here• from •here•; 
	- Here I am, and there's been a continuum, and Here I am
- everything that led to where I now am was helpful and good, but not too helpful if I spend too much time looking in that direction
	- but all of that existed before this
	- %% appreciate each chapter of the book, but you don't have to re-read each chapter %%
- how to: 
	- acknowledge how I fit into this continuum
		- WITHOUT doing a disservice to myself in the process
