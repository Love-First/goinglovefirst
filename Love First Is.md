Hello everyone,

Love First is a consciously practiced way of life, designed for those who wish to feel good about themselves and others, and live with purpose in the co-creation of Harmony: a world made with love.


To make something with love, I use the elements of Universal Love—water, earth, fire, and air—

The Water Element reminds us to Be Truthful, honest, and transparent. Water blocks help you to joyfully discover your authentic, fullest self, to to have fun in the process and to feel good about who you are and where you are at, even if your surroundings are not ready for you yet.

The Fire Element reminds us to Embrace Vulnerability, leaning into the discomfort and seeing what it is we are trying not to see.

Love First is [[What Is Love First#A Life Philosophy|A Life Philosophy]] designed to be universally useful and applicable. That means the core elemental principles and practices that form [[The Foundations Of Love First]] can be used by you in any area of your life: personal, professional, hobbies, art, science, business, and anything else.

That is obviously easier said than done, and “gee, how useful, something really vague that is ‘for everyone’” (insert perfectly justified eye roll here). So let’s make this more tangible, concrete, and specific.
