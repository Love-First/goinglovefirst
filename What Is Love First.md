# [[Love First Is]]…

Love First is a set of ideas and practices to develop greater understanding of Love as a skill or technique that
Building a better world for everyone, one wherein all people feel a sense of love and belonging and are supported in their needs, while you yourself live a life doing what you love and leading by example, in support of this goal.

Love First is for people who wish to live in harmony with one another and with nature, and hold social good 


Our world deserves more love 💖

If you find yourself feeling 
alone or lonely,
depressed or anxious,
struggling to form deep and meaningful relationships,
or afraid of the mounting challenges humanity faces… then you **really** deserve more love in your life.

Love First is a new type of “thing”; at the heart, it’s a simple idea: that when we act from a place of love, *first*, we get the best possible outcomes for our actions, and cultivate greater love into our lives.


## A Life Philosophy
Life On Earth Is Complicated, and becoming more so every day. 


## For A Brighter Future
We, the people of this planet, have made a world full of beauty and magic, inspiring billions of individuals to dream and create great things. 

It's easy to look at the state of the world and feel disheartened, 

## [[In A World…]]
Where we have X, we can Y
Where we have X, we can Y
Where we have X, we can Y
And in a world where we have love, we can outshine the darkness.


## Built On The Foundations Of Love
Ask a thousand people what “love” means to them, and you get a thousand unique interpretations. 

Love is a universal force much greater than an intense feeling of deep affection, and yet for centuries we have not researched it as something that can be understood and explored the way we look at physics or biology. We do have centuries of artists, poets, and dreamers all capturing the essence of love as vividly as they could. They shared their interpretations, shaping the soul of humanity and giving color to our civilization (such as we may call it).

Unlike fields of study based on mathematics, love has no equation—for love has no equal, and no negative. Still, there is a shape to love, a pattern or form, that can be understood even in the simplest of ways. Love First interprets love through a lens of those fundamentals, identifying core elemental principles and practices that are easy to understand (at a high level), and easy to apply in many of life’s challenges.

Acting from a place of love, when faced with pain or hostility, is made easier by the foundations of Love First. 

It’s simpler and easier…

## For You, For Us, And For…
Everyone. Each and every one of us is, in our own unique way, an authority on love.

Love First is personal development through storytelling, gamification, and puzzle-solving. And because so much of it works through practices that foster greater connection with the people we care for in our lives, each participant’s growth flows love to both themselves and those around them. 

We can all be artists, by choosing to turn what we do *into* our art. 

## Us *And* Them
Competition in sports or in the marketplace of ideas and commerce is healthy, but we mustn’t let the zero-sum-game mindset of competition drive our thinking for community building, social systems, or governance.

We are not alone in this world, and we
