# A New Introduction To Love

## What Is Universal Love

In Love First, in this Harmony, we believe that this is a loving universe, that love is the currency of this universe, and that the universe loves all of us. Not as some kind of sentient entity, like a deity or God, but in the [scientific relational view](https://interestingengineering.com/a-new-theory-indicates-our-physical-reality-may-be-nothing-but-quantum-mirrors) of space and time.

Universal Love is the practice of seeing the joy and beauty in everything that is, being at peace with the perfection of this world, and learning to love your own existence within it. 

Universal Love, or simply Love (with a capital L) espouses the belief that through sufficient practice of [[Love Is A Skill|love as a skill]], a person can experience feelings of boundless love for oneself as well as boundless love for all others. It is a way of loving the universe and all that is in it, including yourself. 

That sounds like a lot of work, but thankfully it isn’t. We’ve been living by the practices of Universal Love for years, and we have good news: the more you learn about them the more you automatically integrate them in your everyday life, and the less you have to think about them.

The goal of using this framework of Universal Love is simple and appealing: to understand how joyful and nourishing it is to know that you can always find love for yourself no matter what your head is trying to convince you of, and that you can always find love for another no matter how much you may feel in opposition to them. There is peace and wisdom and happiness and *[[I Feel So Good|feeling so, so good]]* in that experience, and we want you to know that it is available to you, that you are worthy of it, that you belong in this world with the enthusiasm of knowing that all that love and more is yours to have and enjoy and to share.

Universal Love can be understood through the five classical elements:

1. Love
2. Water
3. Earth
4. Fire
5. Air

We call these [[The Elements Of Love]], and they represent a collection of practices

Everyone is an authority on love, in the simplest form of **a feeling of safety, connection, comfort, and ecstatic joy**. This form of love may be for another person: that connection between your heart and theirs, that experience of joy when you hold them in your arms, or that feeling of melting when they smile at you with mezmerizing eyes. It may be for something tangible and inanimate, like that delicious meal someone cooked for you and for which they said “the secret ingredient is love.”
