# How (Long â€¢â€¢ Well) Do You Know Me?

I'm starting an informal experiment. The hypothesis is Mary Lou Kownackiâ€™s quote:

> There isnâ€™t anyone you couldnâ€™t love once youâ€™ve heard their story.

ðŸ’–  I believe we can cultivate more love and harmony in our social communities by transparently sharing our story, and inviting our friends & family to share theirs.

ðŸ’–  I believe we don't know each other as well as we could, and would benefit from spending more time connecting on deeper human levels, and less on discussing and debating opinions.

ðŸ’–  I believe a list of workplaces, schools, or cities you lived in, doesn't paint a compelling picture to showcase the richness of who you are.

ðŸ’–  I believe we, as a people, can accomplish greatness at a global scale: the kind of greatness that bridges heartbreaking divides, heals multigenerational traumas at scale, builds a civilization that supports every individual to live a healthy and happy life, addresses the challenges we face and mitigates the threats against nature, our life-giving environment upon which our entire existence depends directly.

So I invite you to answer the question above, and answer it however you'd like:

How do you know me?
How long do you know me?
How _well_ do you know me?

I've divided my life up into a set of chapters for easy reference; also, feel free to ask about any chapters that spark your curiosity.

If this experiment speaks to you and you would like to replicate it, please go ahead! Want an image like this of your own to go with it? I'm happy to make one for a small fee, DM me for details.
