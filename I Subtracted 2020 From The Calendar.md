# I Subtracted 2020 From The Calendar—And It’s Been Great

> Wouldn’t it be great if the year 2020 never happened?

I imagine that was one of the most pervasive sentiments shared across the globe as last year came to its close. And yet personally, I was strangely appreciative of The Year of Apocalypses. Not for its ceaseless torrent of heartbreaking horrors and suffering, but for the revelatory powers the COVID-19 Pandemic presented. Many were profound and beautiful; many more were dreadful and depressing, but whichever way the revelations of 2020 swung for you, they shifted things for us. For *all* of us.

Some larger, shared revelations I particularly appreciate:
- We are far more interdependent and interconnected than we were willing to acknowledge at scale;
- We are not alone in any of our struggles, not even when we are at our most alone _physically;_
- Our global supply chain infrastructure is *incredibly* impressive—and something we perhaps rely on too heavily for essential needs;
- People are absolutely fed up with the exploitative wealth concentration of profit-first capitalism and centralized institutions, whether by social media platforms—like Facebook or Google—or Wall Street banks. (The latter of which have turned to buying up real estate as their next big quest in usurping all of humanity for the sake of extracting wealth out of everyone and doing nothing with it);
- People are similarly fed up with being chronically underpaid and undervalued by employers, whether those employers prioritize money over their own people, or are service industry businesses that have historically relied on exploiting labor through cheap wages that, today, no longer provide a living wage.

2020 was also the year of history’s largest worldwide movement of unity for love. More than 65 **million** people marched in peaceful protest against racism, injustice, and police brutality, _despite being in the midst of a global pandemic_. And that number doesn’t even include the many millions more who stayed indoors out of an understandable abundance of safety. 

For all of 2020’s awfulness, it brought together a world of people in global acts of love: collaboration, connection (through different means), and co-creation. We adapted as a unified world and, despite enormous ongoing conflict and division existing still within, we demonstrated the most fundamental of human qualities:

## [[The Only Reason We've Come This Far Is Because We've Helped Each Other]]
Humans and other animals don’t differ 

## [[I Decided To Try Something New]]
In January of 2021 I started a new calendar system. It’s used informally for now, but will have more widely-applicable purposes in the future.

We are now in Year One Of Love
