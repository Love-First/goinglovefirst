## As a statement

As a statement about the context for the upcoming document itself, "Context Matters" means that information is always subjective to the context in which it is provided `AND` the context in which it is interpreted.

### Providing Context
The following items of information can be important, even essential, in providing valuable context to any document:
- author(s) and co-creator(s)
- date of creation or publishing
- 

Provided contexts are within control of the content‚Äôs creator(s), unlike

### Interpreted Context
Each person brings with them their own unique (and beautiful) perspective and, thus, their subjective interpreting context. As a creator of any kind of content, you have **no** control over the interpreted context that your audience brings. This is to be celebrated because it makes you and each person from your audience the co-creators of a unique bridge of human experiences and understanding.

Revel in the joy of creating something uniquely yours-and-theirs, or as written from your perspective, *‚Äúuniquely ours and ours alone.‚Äù*
