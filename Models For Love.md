# Models For Love

Love First is built on a collection of conceptual models that help you apply *Love First-aligned* ways of thinking about challenges, conflicts, or circumstances you may encounter in life. 


%%
These models are meant to………
%%

## [[Multidimensionality]]
💖

## [[The Universal Growth Model]]
💧

## [[The Möbius Strip Model]]
🌍

## [[Everything Is A Spectrum]]
🔥

## N+1: [[The Model Of Infinite Possibility]]
💨 


For instance, imagine the GLF platform having the following configurable buttons below an essay or piece:

```
   [ 👍🏼 ] [ 💖 ]  |  [ +1 ]  |  [ … ]
```


With:
- `[ 👍🏼 ]` I support/agree with this
- `[ 💖 ]` I support/agree with AND I love this (=embrace =add to personal profile)
- `[ +1 ]` I have something to add to this
- `[ … ]` (other/optionals •/•) 


Meaning, anytime that you as a creator enable the `[ +1 ]` button for a particular piece, you are inviting people to co-create it into something greater.
