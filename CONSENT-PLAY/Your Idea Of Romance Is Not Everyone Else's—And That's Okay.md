**“Romance is making your partner’s fantasies come true.”**

I had never thought of defining what romance was until my girlfriend at the time shared this perspective with me. We were in our early-to-mid 20’s, embarking on a relationship more meaningful and significant than any I‘d had until then. Before then, I had let media culture (and the dictionary) define it for me, and I accepted it fairly as-is. Yet somewhere in the back of my mind there was an itch, a minor discomfort about it; was other people’s definition of romance *really* what I was supposed to adhere to?

Most of my life—both before then and ever since—can be characterized by this quote:

![[Ralph Waldo Emerson#^f550eb]]

To me, it means not having to follow the “normal” path in life, of *school → college → job → retirement*, or the relationship escalator of *dating → living together → engagement → get married → have kids*. Deviate whenever you can, whenever you want to, and live boldly authentically.
