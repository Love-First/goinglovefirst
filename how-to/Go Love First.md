## You Want
You believe we can live in a better world.

You believe you deserve a life that you love living every day, with meaningful relationships, fulfilling work and activities that give you a sense of contribution, and for which you feel appreciated by your community. 
You want more peace, more fairness, more wellbeing.

You want a world with more love in it, and believe it to be possible.

So do we.

## The World
> Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.

There is so much heartbreak in the world. So much injustice, inequality, and unnecessary suffering. We have built our society on systems that disenfranchise the many in favor of the few. Corporations impact and shape the lives of billions, yet put profits over all those people’s lives. Disinformation is becoming the new currency, poisoning the wells of online discourse. Political divisions are tearing at the social fabric of our very civilization, and to top it all off, we have a climate crisis to address and mitigate—and far too little collaborative will and energy to do it right.

The world *needs* more love, and you’d like to see that happen.

## To Be Better
> Be a lamp, or a lifeboat or a ladder. Help someone's soul heal.

You know that to make a better world starts with being the best version of yourself. You understand it as an ongoing process of uncovering and healing traumas, of learning better ways to connect with yourself and interact with others, of growing and evolving as a person. 

You understand that to be there for others, the first step is putting the mask on for yourself.

## The First Step In *Going Love First*
> Only from the heart can you touch the sky

To “go Love First” is to declare your intent to bring and enjoy more love in your life (and thus by proxy, the world), and to practice one small, sweet step every day, any day, whenever you can. It is a single question to ask yourself before any act or interaction, or during any conflict or frustration:

💖 ***What would be a more universally loving approach in this moment?***

That’s it! That is all it takes as a daily practice to bring new flows of love into your life. After some time your conscious effort will become unconscious habit, if it isn’t already, and you'll find that something curious will happen: an increase in serendipity.

## Serendipity is a common side-effect of love
There is no good measure for “love” in quantitative ways, but a reliable indicator of the presence of Love is how often you find that things just seem to be… easier. Like finding that perfect parking spot open up just as you arrive, or a helping hand is offered when you were too afraid to ask. Serendipity is the product of a loving universe’s many currents converging in a peaceful balance, like string instruments playing in harmony. (There’s also a science to it, but we’ll get to that later.)

## The Next Steps

But what does it mean to *be loving*, and isn’t that subjective? What is *Universal Love*, and how is it different from just… love?  Obviously, changing the world takes a lot more than just one simple practice…right?

These and many more are the right questions to ask, and each deserves a proper answer. In the pieces to come we will dive into them all and explore the fabric or *structure* of Love. We’ll reverse engineer and break it down into repeatable practices for use in your everyday life.

## This is a grand experiment in love

Consider this an experiment to see how far we can come, how much we can learn and improve, and how well we can heal the pains in this world when we align our collective efforts with a simple but powerful framework of love. We’d love for you to join us, and your only required investment is your time and attention, as little or as much as works best for you. That’s it.

In fact, we’ll even provide you with building blocks to speed up your journey, such as this template that shows how easy and simple *going Love First* can be to start:

> I am going Love First, because I want to live in a happier world and bring more love into my life. My practice will be to contemplate this question on a regular basis:
> 💖 ***What would be a more universally loving approach in this moment?***

You could simply copy and put that somewhere as your starting declaration, whether as a public post on social media or a sticky note on your computer. That’s up to you, as are any of the words you use around 💖 ***the question.***

Will you join us?
