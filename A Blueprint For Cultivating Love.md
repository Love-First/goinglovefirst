# A Blueprint For Cultivating Love
## Use the five elements to align and foster greater love into efforts of harmonious co-creation.

This blueprint serves as a framework for driving clarity on why, how, and what you are doing, creating, co-creating, or organizing. All efforts made with an embodiment of the elements below can bring those efforts into harmonious alignment, both with each other as well as with the frequency of love.

**How to use this blueprint:**  
The headings describe the essence of each element, and should be left alone, while the prompts are fully replaceable suggestions or starting points. You can use this as a questionnaire and answer any or all of the prompts (and any of your own), to get a clearer picture of the love that is present within the desire to reify your idea. You can also use the headings alone as inspiration for what fundamental currents of love flow through this idea already. Or, you can use (and rearrange) the headings as a hidden template, to ensure each element is represented in something you are writing or creating.

## The Heart Element: Love
- Why do you love this?
- What do you love (doing) in life, and how does this relate or play into that?
- What important values—beyond those of Love First itself—apply here?

## The Air Element: Believe In Possibility
- What is one incredible thing you would love to see could come of this?
- What does this make possible, that wasn’t before?
- What’s exciting about this opportunity?
- What new potential can this offer?
- How might this change reality for you? For others? For the world?

## The Water Element: Be Truthful
- What is the truth you seek to share with the world and bring to light with this? 
- What excites you about honesty, authenticity, and transparency as values? 
- How are honesty, transparency, and/or authenticity represented in this?
- What feels authentic about doing this, for you?

## The Earth Element: Share Your Story
- How did you get here, and why you are making this? *(No need to always tell the whole story, you can capture its essence in a single statement or paragraph.)*
- Who or what are the giants whose shoulders you are standing on? 
- Who are representative role models or examples of the values for this project?
- What makes this a co-creation between more people, and how do participants get their contributions heard, seen, or represented?

## The Fire Element: Embrace Vulnerability
- Who does this empower, and how?
- What risks are you taking by doing this?
- What feels scary about it, and why are you going to do it anyway?
