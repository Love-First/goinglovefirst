Philosopher Karl Popper explained the paradox as meaning that “in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.”

Per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance):
> The paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant.

The word *“intolerance”* is critical, for Love First welcomes all *people*, but asserts healthy boundaries against harmful *ideologies*.

The two protocols Love First uses that apply here are [[Harm Reduction]] and [[The Robustness Principle]].
