**Short version:** punch Nazis. 

**Nuanced version:** there is a threshold in the [[Everything Is A Spectrum|Spectrum]] of ideologies, past which the ideology is considered *intrinsically intolerant*. Nazism is the most famous of ideologies that is predicated on a belief system that *by its own definition* is intolerant of certain people. The ideology of white supremacy is similarly *intrinsically* intolerant, as it categorizes all non-white people as inferior human beings (at best). 

If an ideology has, at its core or in its espoused practices and principles, a differentiation of people based on inalienable attributes of their being, and uses that differentiation to favor one group of people over another, it is considered **intrinsically intolerant.** 

This leads us to [[The Paradox Of Tolerance]], which explains why we must always be intolerant of ideologies that are *intrinsically intolerant*.
