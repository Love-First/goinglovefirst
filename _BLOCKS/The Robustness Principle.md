Also known as Postel’s Law, the [Robustness Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) states:

> Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.

However, I adapted it for use in general life & human interaction circumstances to read:

> Be precise in what you do, and be tolerant in what you accept.

Both forms of the principle are considered essential every-day practice in Love First.

## [[How It Works|Putting The Robustness Principle Into Practice]]
Let’s break down the two forms of the principle by first and second halves:

> Be conservative in what you do
> Be precise in what you do

As a practicing [[Love First Person]], to be conservative means to be measured, restrained, and reasonable; to not exaggerate, and to not be excessive or reactionary. [[Practice Mindfulness|Be Mindful]] and relaxed, and act from a place of wisdom, patience, and kindness. To be *precise* means to be intentional, conscious, and specific with your words and actions.
