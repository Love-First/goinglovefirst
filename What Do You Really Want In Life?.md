# What Do You Really Want In Life?

Do you want to feel good in life?
Do you want to feel good about the life you have, every day?
Do you want to feel happy and safe and secure in your home environment every day?
Do you want to feel nourished and nurtured by the relationships you have with other people, friends and family, and romantic and intimate partners?
Do you want to feel happy about the food you eat and the work you do?
Do you want to delight in the joys of satisfaction for contributing to your community and being valued for your contributions?

Do you want all that? 

Because it is yours for the taking. 
It is yours to have. 
You deserve it, 
you are worthy of it,
you are allowed to have it, 
and you get to celebrate every little bit of it.
Every bit that you have and every time you get a little bit more of it.

Would it be okay with you if you got that in a way that does not require you telling other people to do or not do something, or how to be or how to think?
Would it be okay with you if you got _all of that_ in a way that doesnâ€™t require other people to sacrifice anything about their lives without their consent?
