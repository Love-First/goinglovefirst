# This Is A Living Document

Every essay, article, piece, post, photo, video, song, or other media creation that states it is A Living Document up front, and links to this document which you are currently reading, announces itself as being in a perpetual state of ongoing evolution, adaptation, or change. 

This does not just mean that “this content is subject to change"—in Love First, we are a lot more precise than that. It is shorthand for the following:

- I may change and become something different in the future;
- I welcome the opportunity for growth and adaptation that change represents;
- I will never be “done” but I am ready for sharing what I am today;
- I will never get it “right” yet I am perfect for what I am;
- My creator(s) stand by what is contained within, unless stated otherwise or unless the version of me you are "consuming" (reading, hearing, watching, feeling) is not the latest version of me that exists;
- *n+1*




## It (also) means…

- This document may just be a seed, growing into a sapling, and eventually be a mighty, sprawling tree. Like a stub on Wikipedia, but with more intentional design.
