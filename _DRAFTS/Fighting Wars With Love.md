The world is in turmoil; societies are in conflict; people are suffering from trauma, hunger, poverty, and rising emotional distresses. Oof.

I get it: it’s easy to reflect on life today, see these terrifying realities, and feel miserable. But ironically, that is actually the *easy* way of living: in resigned despondency. It’s hard carrying the weight of the world around you, but even harder to let go of that despair and focus on the beauty, the wondrous, and the nebulousness (and, perhaps, seemingly out of reach) of optimistic futures that inspire us into positive action.

It’s the same reason why it’s easy to write dystopian stories, and harder to write optimistic futures like Star Trek: extrapolating negatives you can see is easier than envisioning something grand that doesn't exist yet at all. (Sorry, Charlie Brooker)

Governments, politicians, and wealthy elites are all power players in a war of mutually assured destruction; sometimes 

My approach is to not fight the war  on the war’s terms, but to undercut the war on Love’s terms. Here’s what I’ve learned to do so far:

• Cultivate greater awareness of how Love works and can be practiced. Love is what you believe and feel it is, but it is also so much more than that. 

• Apply the elements and practices of Love into all areas of your life, which (greatly) reduces anxiety, depression, and stress, while improving hope and optimism, creativity and problem-solving, connection with others, and healing from our personal and collective traumas.

• Subversively reframe every aspect of human life and society wherever you can, and point all (reframed) energies towards possibility. Stop thinking along the axes of good/bad (moral), left/right (political), strong/weak (power); start thinking instead of everything as its own spectrum, of abundant love and the absence of love, of sustainable harmonious growth or exploitation of human and natural resources.

• Practice doing and being a little bit better every single day. Own Your Actions. Practice Mindfulness. Play Together.

A true heart at peace has no desire for conflict or the subjugation of others. A true heart at peace can weather disinformation storms and the fluctuation of facts through the turbulence of ever-evolving contexts. A true heart at peace knows Universal Love is justice, liberty, and Harmony for all.
