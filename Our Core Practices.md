# Our Core Practices

These are practices you can apply in your life each day as needed. They are intentionally phrased very specifically, the reasons for which will be explained as requested. Message Faruk on any platform you’re connected to him to request a practice be explained.

## The #Five Elemental Practices
The five elements represent the foundations of Love First as a way of life, and their associated practices are recommended to be taken to heart deeply, even meditated upon from time to time. Apply them in your life as often as possible, as needed or as desired, to cultivate a deep foundation of love. 

1. Love (Heart)
2. Be Truthful And Transparent (Water)
3. Embrace Vulnerability (Fire)
4. Believe In Possibility (Air)
5. Share Your Story (Earth)
